        <h1>Fitness</h1>
        <p>If you have diabetes, being active makes your body more sensitive to insulin (the hormone that allows cells in your body to use blood sugar for energy), which helps manage your diabetes. Physical activity also helps control blood sugar levels and lowers your risk of heart disease and nerve damage.Some additional benefits include:
             Maintaining a healthy weight
            Losing weight, if needed
            Feeling happier
            Sleeping better
            Improving your memory
            Controlling your blood pressure
            Lowering LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and raising HDL (“good”) cholesterol
            The goal is to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity. One way to do this is to try to fit in at least 20 to 25 minutes of activity every day. Also, on 2 or more days a week, include activities that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).</p>

    Find something you like. Exercising by doing something you enjoy is important because if you don’t like it, you won’t stick with it. Find an activity that you and your health care provider agree you can do regularly for the best results.
Start small. If you’re not already physically active you should begin slowly and work your way up to the desired level. For example, you could park farther from the door, take the stairs, do yard work, or walk the dog. Start small and gradually add a little more time and intensity each week.
Find a partner. It’s more fun when someone else is counting on you to show up. Having a partner may help you continue to be active.
Pick a goal. An example of a goal could be to walk a mile every day for a month or to be active every weekday for 30 minutes. Be specific and realistic. Always discuss your activity goals with your health care provider.
Schedule it in. The more regular activity you do, the quicker it will become a habit. Think of ways to link activity to daily life. For example, you could schedule walking with a co-worker after lunch. Try not to go more than 2 days in a row without being active. Before starting any physical activity, check with your health care provider to talk about the best physical activities for you. Be sure to discuss which activities you like, how to prepare, and what you should avoid.

Drink plenty of fluids while being physically active to prevent dehydration (harmful loss of water in the body).
Make sure to check your blood sugar before being physically active, especially if you take insulin.
If it’s below 100 mg/dL, you may need to eat a small snack containing 15-30 grams of carbohydrates, such as 2 tablespoons of raisins or ½ cup of fruit juice or regular soda (not diet), or glucose tablets so your blood sugar doesn’t fall too low while being physically active. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can be very serious.
If it’s above 240 mg/dL, your blood sugar may be too high (hyperglycemia) to be active safely. Test your urine for ketones – substances made when your body breaks down fat for energy. The presence of ketones indicates that your body doesn’t have enough insulin to control your blood sugar. If you are physically active when you have high ketone levels, you risk ketoacidosis – a serious diabetes complication that needs immediate treatment.

        <p>If you’re not into regular exercise, putting together an exercise plan can be a bummer.

            But remember, along with your diet and medications, regular physical activity is an important part of managing diabetes or dealing with prediabetes. Because when you’re active, your cells become more sensitive to insulin so it works more effectively to lower your blood glucose, also known as blood sugar. (You might notice that exercising sometimes raises your blood glucose, find out why.)
