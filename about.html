            <div class="sectionLeft">When your digestive system breaks down food, your blood sugar level rises. The body cells absorb the sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream and use it for energy. The cells do this using a hormone called insulin, which is produced by the pancreas, an organ near the stomach. When your body doesn’t produce enough insulin and/or doesn’t efficiently use the insulin it produces, sugar levels rise in the bloodstream. As a result, right away, the body cells may be starved for energy. Over time, high blood glucose levels may damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves or heart.</div>
