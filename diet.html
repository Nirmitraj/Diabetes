        <h1>Diet</h1>
        <p>Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and heart problems.And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on. If you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, so that you get the right amount of carbs in each meal or snack. You'll learn how to count carbs and measure your food.

            Eating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.
            
            Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.
            
            Eating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.</p>

    Eating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:
    Fruits and vegetables
    Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats
    Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu
    Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. To keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you will need to have them less often or in smaller amounts.
    High-carb foods and drinks, such as:
    Sugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar
    Drinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks
    White rice, tortillas, breads and pasta - especially those made with white flour
    Starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas
    Fried foods and other foods high in saturated trans fats.
    Foods high in sodium (salt).
    Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man.

        <p>Foods to avoid

            Diabetes raises your risk of heart disease and stroke by raising the rate at which you develop clogged and hardened arteries. Foods containing the following can work against your goal of a heart-healthy diet.
            
            Saturated fats. Avoid high-fat dairy products and animal proteins such as butter, beef, hot dogs, sausage and bacon. Limit coconut and palm kernel oils.
            Trans fats. Avoid trans fats found in processed snacks, baked goods, shortening and stick margarines.
            Cholesterol. Cholesterol sources include high-fat dairy products and high-fat animal proteins, egg yolks, liver, and other organ meats. Aim for no more than 200 milligrams (mg) of cholesterol a day.
            Sodium. Aim for no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day. Your health care provider may suggest you aim for a smaller amount if you have high blood pressure./p>
